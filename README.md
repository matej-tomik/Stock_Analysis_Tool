# Stock Analysis Tool

## Application Description
Our application provides simplified stock analysis using three popular valuation models: Discounted Cash Flow (DCF), Dividend Discount Model (DDM), and Graham Number/Model.

### Features:
1. **DCF Analysis:** Estimate the intrinsic value of a stock based on projected future cash flows. Input key financial metrics and growth assumptions, and the DCF model calculates a fair value estimate.
2. **DDM Analysis:** Evaluate a stock's worth based on expected future dividend payments. Input dividend yield, growth rate, and discount rate to obtain a valuation.
3. **Graham Number:** Assess whether a stock is undervalued based on earnings per share (EPS) and book value per share (BVPS), named after renowned investor Benjamin Graham.
