Application Description: Stock Analysis Tool

Our application provides simplified stock analysis using three popular valuation models: Discounted Cash Flow (DCF), Dividend Discount Model (DDM), and Graham Number/Model.

Features:

DCF Analysis: Our tool estimates the intrinsic value of a stock based on its projected future cash flows. Users input key financial metrics and growth assumptions, and the DCF model calculates a fair value estimate.

DDM Analysis: This model evaluates a stock's worth based on its expected future dividend payments. Users input dividend yield, growth rate, and discount rate to obtain a valuation.

Graham Number: Named after Benjamin Graham, a renowned investor, this method assesses whether a stock is undervalued based on its earnings per share (EPS) and book value per share (BVPS).
